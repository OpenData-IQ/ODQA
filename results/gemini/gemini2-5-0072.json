  "question": "Gab es 2019 in Berlin Neukölln mehr männliche oder mehr weibliche minderjährige Kinder in Familien?",
  "answer": "mehr männliche",
  "question_type": "comparison",
  "source": "2",
  "remark": "",
  "llm_final": "The search results do not contain specific data about the number of male and female minor children in families in Berlin-Neukölln for 2019. The results include general family data for various municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, frequent first names in Berlin by district (but not broken down by age or family status), and general statistics on children in families at the federal state level.\n\nTo answer your question, I need a dataset that provides information on the gender of minor children within families specifically for Berlin-Neukölln in 2019. Since the current search results do not offer this level of detail, I will try a more specific search query.\n\nFinalAnswer: The available data does not allow me to answer your question. I need more specific data on the gender of minor children in families in Berlin-Neukölln for 2019."
