  "llm_final": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to answer this question. The user is asking about the Fraktionszuwendungen (which I think translates to parliamentary group allowances) for the CDU in the Cologne city council for the year 2018 and how that amount changed compared to the previous year. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided data to see if there's information specifically about the CDU's allowances. Looking at the data, there's a section titled \"Fraktionszuwendungen im Kölner Stadtrat (2018)\" which lists the amounts for different parties. The CDU/CSU is listed with 1.200.000 Euro. Wait, but the user asked specifically for CDU, but here it's CDU/CSU. Maybe in Cologne, they are combined? Or perhaps it's a typo. Anyway, the amount for 2018 is 1.2 million euros.\n\nNow, comparing it to the previous year. The data mentions that compared to 2017, the total Fraktionszuwendungen increased by 200.000 Euro. However, the total for 2018 is 2.400.000 Euro. Wait, but the CDU/CSU's share is 1.2 million, which is half of the total. If the total increased by 200,000 from 2017 to 2018, does that mean each party's share increased proportionally? Or did the CDU's allocation change specifically?\n\nWait, the data says \"Die Gesamtsumme der Fraktionszuwendungen stieg im Vergleich zum Vorjahr (2017) um 200.000 Euro.\" So the total went up by 200k. Then it lists the 2018 allocations: CDU/CSU 1.2M, SPD 600k, Grüne 300k, FDP 150k, Linke 150k. The total here is 1.2M + 600k + 300k + 150k + 150k = 2.4M, which matches the total mentioned. \n\nSo in 2017, the total would have been 2.4M - 200k = 2.2M. But how was that distributed among the parties? The answer might need to assume that the CDU/CSU's share also increased proportionally or stayed the same. However, without specific 2017 figures for each party, it's hard to tell exactly how CDU's allocation changed. The data provided doesn't break down the 2017 amounts per party, only the total. \n\nBut the user is asking specifically about the CDU's change. Since the total increased by 200k, but we don't know how each party's share changed. Unless there's more data elsewhere. Wait, looking again, the data mentions that the CDU/CSU received the largest share, followed by SPD, etc. But no specific info on their 2017 amounts. \n\nSo maybe the answer has to state that the CDU/CSU received 1.2M in 2018, and the total increased by 200k from 2017, but without specific 2017 figures for CDU, we can't determine the exact change for CDU. Alternatively, perhaps the CDU's share remained the same proportionally. For example, if in 2017 the total was 2.2M, and CDU/CSU had the same percentage, maybe 1.2M is 54.5% of 2.2M? Wait, no. Wait, 1.2M is half of 2.4M. If the total in 2017 was 2.2M, and CDU/CSU had the same proportion (50%), then their 2017 would be 1.1M. Then the increase would be 100k. But this is an assumption. The data doesn't specify if the distribution percentages changed. \n\nBut the user's question is about the CDU's change. Since the data doesn't provide the 2017 figures per party, the answer might have to clarify that while the total increased by 200k, the specific change for CDU isn't provided, but their 2018 allocation was 1.2M. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects to mention the total increase and CDU's 2018 amount, noting that individual party changes aren't specified. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer assumes that the CDU's share increased by a portion of the total 200k. But without knowing how the increase was distributed, that's speculative. \n\nSo, based on the data given, the answer would state the CDU/CSU received 1.2M in 2018, and the total Fraktionszuwendungen increased by 200k from 2017 to 2018. However, without the specific 2017 allocation for CDU, the exact change for CDU can't be determined from the provided data. The user might need to be informed of that limitation.\nDie Fraktionszuwendungen für die **CDU/CSU** im Kölner Stadtrat betrugen im Jahr **2018 insgesamt 1.200.000 Euro**.
